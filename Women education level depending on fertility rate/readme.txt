**This Program will predict the education level of a group of women in india depending on the fertility rate of different age groups.**

This program uses the data from 2006-2011 from the open data library of indian govt. which you can download from the following link-
https://data.gov.in/catalog/total-fertility-rate-and-age-specific-fertility-rates-educational-level-women


In this program uses the concept of clustring and the k neighbors algorithm for prediction.

The test score of the data combined with k neighbor algorithm resulted to a good accuracy of around or above 80%.

The csv file which contains the data is also present in the project folder.

The column named "Year" and "Area" are irrelevant and has been dropped off.
 Column named "Educational Level of the Women" is used as label while remaining other column are our features.

To get the output, run the python file and insert the data specifically w.r.t. with its column separated by space.

The console will show the education level of the group depending on the inserted value.

Any extreme value will be taken as outliers.
